            <p className="mb-4">
              A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on your computer, mobile device, tablet or 
              other device when you visit a website or use an application. Cookies are then sent back to 
              the platform on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie, 
              and allows the website to recognize the user's device.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Some cookies are deleted when you close the window of your browser. These are known as 
              <strong> session cookies</strong>. Without such cookies, when you restart your browser and 
              return to the platform, the platform will not recognize you and you will have to log in 
              again. Other cookies remain on your device until they expire or you delete them from your 
              cache. These are known as <strong> persistent cookies</strong> and enable us to remember 
              things about you as a returning visitor.
